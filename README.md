## Introduction

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMGâ€™s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMGâ€™s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. The project is mainly divided into three tasks:

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
#### Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

* Customer Demographic 
* Customer Addresses
* Transactions data in the past 3 months

I performed the preliminary data exploration and identify ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltdâ€™s data.

## Task 2: Data Insights
#### Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.

* In building this recommendation, we started with a PowerPoint presentation which outlined the approach which we will be taking. 
* The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.
* Prepared a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities â€“ i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting.

## Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation
#### Using visualisations to present insights

Developed a dashboard using Power BI that displays the data summary and results of the analysis. Some of the focussed business context when presenting findings were: 
* What are the trends in the underlying data?
* Which customer segment has the highest customer value?
* What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd â€™s marketing and growth strategy?
* What additional external datasets may be useful to obtain greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products?
